A **Great Advice**: read everything before you start doing anything. If you have any questions file an issue [here](https://github.com/ProjSante/webapp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5B+%3Abug%3A+%5D+-+) and try to explain with as much details as you can.

## Request a new Feature or File a Bug

> Do you want the project to :sparkles:? Fill in a feature request so we can make it even more awesome :rocket:

Just before you do it, checkout [here](https://github.com/ProjSante/webapp/issues) if an issue hasn't been filed.

- **If not**, go ahead and [Get Started](https://github.com/ProjSante/webapp/issues/new/choose) with your `Bug Repport` or `Feature Request`. In case it's an issue remember to give as much detail as possible so we can reproduce the probem.

- **If it has**, checkout the comments to see if there is someone working on it and say you wana help. Ask for guidance if necessary.
