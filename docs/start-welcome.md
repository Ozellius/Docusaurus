Here you will find all the information about the Follow.ER project.

Follow.ER is a system that integrates [**Devices**](doc3.md) with sensors collecting vital sings.
A collection of [**Devices**](doc3.md) send these signs to one [**Relay**](doc2.md), even if a facility can have more than one.
And the [**Relay**](.doc2md) is responsible to communicate with the [**API**](api-routes.md).
If a facility wishes, they can integrate the [**API**](api-routes.md) into an existing service, or they can use the [**WebApp**](git-dev-environment.md).
